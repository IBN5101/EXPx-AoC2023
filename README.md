## About Advent of Code

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Installation & Usage

These solutions are written and executed using Python 3.12 (later versions are fine too, probably).

**The puzzle input of each day is personalized/randomized to each account on AoC.** My personal inputs have been redacted. However, some solutions have hardcoded solution numbers using brute force attempts or Wolfram Alpha. Please refer to the comments on those solutions for further details.

To use the solutions, please register an account on AoC to obtain the inputs. 

For day N, put the input in the folder `dayN` as `dayN.txt`, with trailing 0 for one-digit days. For example, day 3 input should be saved as `./day03/day03.txt`.
